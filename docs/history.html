                    <p>According to the archeological evidence, there has been human habitation within the
                        territory of the Mexican state of Michoacán for at least 10,000 years. In the pre-Hispanic
                        period, there were waves of migration into the area, including the Pirinda, Nahua, Huetamo,
                        Colima, Purépecha and other peoples. There are sites of formal settlements from all
                        Mesoamerican periods. Important sites include El Opeño and those in Curutarán, Tepalcatepec,
                        Apatzingán, Zinapécuaro and Coalcomán. The territory has been inhabited by the Nahua, Otomi,
                        Matlatzinca, Pirinda and Teco peoples as well as the Purépecha.
                    </p>

                    <p> The main pre-Hispanic civilization of the state is that of the Purépecha, which was centered in
                        the Lake Pátzcuaro area.[15] Before the 13th century, both Nahua and Purépecha peoples were here,
                        sustaining themselves by agriculture and fishing. The Purépecha are descendants of a late arrival
                        of Chichimeca who came from the north. At Lake Patzcuaro, they came upon people with similar
                        cultures to their own but who were more technically and socially advanced. The formation of the
                        Purépechan state in the 13th century, when these people started their own dominion at Uayameo,
                        today Santa Fé de la Laguna, and becoming dominant over the entire Lake Patzcuaro area by the
                        15th century. Conquest of neighboring tribes and territories occurred between 1401 and 1450, as
                        they absorbed peoples with different cultures and languages into the empire. By the late 15th
                        century, this state rivaled that of the Aztecs, having expanded their territory over much of
                        what is now Michoacán and into part of Colima, Nayarit, Querétaro, Guanajuato, Guerrero and
                        Jalisco. The Aztec attempted to invade the Purépecha but were repelled. Because of this attack,
                        the Purépecha later denied the Aztecs aid in their defense of Tenochtitlan against the Spanish
                        and the Tlaxcala.
