                                city is in the Guayangareo Valley and is the capital and largest city of the state. The main pre-Hispanic

                                Mendoza founded a settlement here in 1541 with the name of Valladolid, which became rival to the nearby
                                city of Pátzcuaro for dominance in Michoacán. In 1580, this rivalry ended in Valladolid's favor and it
                                became the capital of the colonial province. After the Mexican War of Independence, the city was renamed
                                Morelia in honor of José María Morelos, who hailed from the city.
