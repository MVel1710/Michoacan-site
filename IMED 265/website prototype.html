        <p> Michoacán is located in Western Mexico, and has a stretch of coastline on the Pacific Ocean to the southwest. It is
            bordered by the states of Colima and Jalisco to the west and northwest, Guanajuato to the north, Querétaro to the

        <p> The name Michoacán is from Nahuatl: Michhuahcān [mit͡ʃˈwaʔkaːn] from michhuah [ˈmit͡ʃwaʔ] ("possessor of fish") and -cān [kaːn]
            (place of) and means "place of the fishermen" referring to those who fish on Lake Pátzcuaro.[9] In pre-Hispanic times, the area
            was the home of the Purépecha Empire, which rivaled the Aztec Empire at the time of Spanish encounter. After the Spanish conquest,
            the empire became a separate province which became smaller over the colonial period. The state and its residents played a major role
            in the Mexican War of Independence.
