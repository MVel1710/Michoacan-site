                    <p>Morelia is a city and municipality in the north central part of the state of Michoacán in central Mexico.[2] The
                        city is in the Guayangareo Valley and is the capital and largest city of the state. The main pre-Hispanic
                        cultures here were the Purépecha and the Matlatzinca, but no major cities were founded in the valley
                        during this time. The Spanish took control of the area in the 1520s. The Spanish under Viceroy Antonio de
                        Mendoza founded a settlement here in 1541 with the name of Valladolid, which became rival to the nearby
                        city of Pátzcuaro for dominance in Michoacán. In 1580, this rivalry ended in Valladolid's favor and it
                        became the capital of the colonial province. After the Mexican War of Independence, the city was renamed
                        Morelia in honor of José María Morelos, who hailed from the city.</p>

                                accessible from Pátzcuaro's pier. It is the largest of five islands in Lake
                                Pátczuaro. These boats can be hired to take visitors around other parts of the lake.
                                The boats are pretty regular and takes approximately 25 minutes to reach the island.
                                The town is known for the butterfly fishermen who are skilled at lowering their

                                        when the Spanish arrived in the 1520s. The city lost most of its population after the Conquest, and what is now called the Tzintzuntzan
                                        archeological site is only the ceremonial center and is located one km east of the current center of the town. The site is located on a hill that
                                        overlooks the modern town and Lake Pátzcuaro. It is situated on a large artificial platform that was excavated into the side of the hill. The
                                        ceremonial center contains a large plaza and several buildings known to house priests and nobility, but the main attraction is the five yácatas or
                                        semi-circular pyramids that face out over the lake area. This ceremonial center was called Taríaran or "House of the Wind". On each of the yacatas
                                        was a temple made of wood, in which the most important rites of the Purépecha people and government took place, including burials, of which about sixty
                                        have been found. These are the best known Purépecha yacatas and are considered to be an icon of the region.</p>

                                    <p> Maruata is a Nahuat indigenous town on the coast of Michoacán, Mexico. It's part
                                        of the Pomaro indigenous community; an isolated, autonomous group of towns that
                                        banded together following the genocidal "motines" era of the 16th century.
                                        Pomaro and the nearby indigenous communities of Coire and Ostula still hold
                                        communal titles to their lands. They have so far rejected outside offers to create
                                        large-scale tourist developments in their territory. Maruata still retains much of
                                        its rustic character, as it slowly develops into a locally run eco-tourism center.</p>

                            <p>The Monarch Butterfly Biosphere Reserve is a World Heritage Site containing most of the over-wintering
                                sites of the eastern population of the monarch butterfly. The reserve is located in the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt pine-oak forests ecoregion on the border
                                of Michoacán and State of Mexico, 100 km (62 miles), northwest of Mexico City. Millions of butterflies arrive in the reserve annually. Butterflies only inhabit
                                a fraction of the 56,000 hectares of the reserve from October–March. The biosphere’s mission is to protect the butterfly species and its habitat.</p>
